<P>These classes actually do the validation on various fields. All of them support being passed the validation
data using an annotation. This means the field being validated is annotated for this validation type and the
information about the validation is specified on the annotation, so this needs to be passed to it.</P>

<p>Some of them get their validation information from a DTO. This is only used for testing, not production.</p>
